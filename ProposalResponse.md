Above Average.

## Comments
 - Sounds really cool. Lots of things going on here. I see its doable and useful. I like it!
 - I assume by GMaps integration, you mean on the phone right?
 - Do you really need the accelerometer? How do you distinguish between tampering versus accidental bumping? Maybe there is an easier way to detect tampering... :O
