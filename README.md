### Description
SmartBike is a physical device which uses GPS and GSM technology to keep you notified of your bike's whereabouts through a user-friendly mobile application. In addition, it detects and notifies you when it suspects that your bike is being stolen or tampered with. SmartBike also uses Bluetooth technology to detect when you are riding your bike and suppresses any warnings if that is the case.
